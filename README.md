<br/>The total number of entries or employees as per this data is 133776 but there is one issue with this table that there are many duplicate entries where one employee got promoted over the time and his/her name appeared more than once with old and new title. So we did further filtering on the data.

<br/>Next table shows data from 1st table without duplicate entries meaning a single employee is mentioned only once with his/her latest title. This time we got the correct figure of these retiring employees. Their number is 90398. The snapshot of this table is below:

Then we further filtered the data to show the title wise number of employees retiring and below is the complete table.

This table tells us that highest number of employees are retiring under the title of Senior Engineer. The sum of all these retiring employees is 90398 as earlier mentioned.

# 2.Eligible Mentorship Analysis

The criteria for this selection was the employees who were born in 1965 and they are still the employees of the firm. Again this data also contain the information of their titles. The snapshot of this table is below:
